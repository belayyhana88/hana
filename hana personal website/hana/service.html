        <h1>My First Blog: Figuring Life Out</h1>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Hey there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹! Welcome to my very first blog. I have no idea what Iâ€™m doing, but hey, that never stopped me before. So, here we go!</p>

<p>My name is Hana Belay Seyum, proudly Ethiopian, raised by the strongest, most hardworking woman I know, my mom. Thereâ€™s this amazing, uplifting feeling I get when I tell people I was raised by a single mom. Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s good or bad, but I love it anyway. my mom is a middle school teacher, and if you ask her students, theyâ€™ll tell you sheâ€™s very controlling. But somehow, they all love her. (Stockholm Syndrome? Maybe. Or maybe sheâ€™s just that awesome.)</p>

<p>Then, thereâ€™s my older brother the most caring and understanding human on earthâ€¦ until he gets mad. And let me tell you, he gets mad at the silliest things. But the best part? He never stays mad for long. So, I just roll my eyes and wait for him to calm down. ðŸ™„</p>

<p>Now, letâ€™s talk about me. Iâ€™m an introvertâ€¦ but only until I find the right people. Then? Oh, good luck shutting me up! ðŸ˜Š Growing up, life threw all sorts of things at me some traumatic, some strengthening, some just plain weird. Middle school was great, high school was meh, and college? That was an experience! I met so many different people who opened my eyes to a whole new world. I also made some questionable decisions, but hey, isnâ€™t that what college is for?</p>

<p>After graduating, I struggled big time to find a job. When I finally landed one as a content editor and social media manager at a startup, I had zero experience. But the owner was nice enough to show me the ropes. I was excitedâ€¦ until I wasnâ€™t. The job started feeling like watching paint dry, and I found myself questioning everything. What do I even want to do with my life?! (Spoiler: I still donâ€™t know.)</p>

<p>So, after 10 months, I quit. Then, I spent five months at home, binge-watching everything and contemplating life. Eventually, I found another job. This one kept me way too busy seven days a week, no rest, no time for myself, not even for a simple hair salon visit! But I stuck with it because, wellâ€¦ life is scary, and I had no clue what else to do.</p>

<p>Then came The Conversation with my boss. Letâ€™s just say, he was a pervert and self-centered. That was my wake-up call. My brother suggested applying for a masterâ€™s degree in Europe, and before I knew it, I was accepted into a university in Italy!</p>

<p>At first, I never wanted to leave Ethiopia because my mom was alone, and I thought everything I needed was there. But you know what they say, everything happens for a reason. If that awkward, unpleasant conversation with my boss never happened, I wouldnâ€™t be here today. Do I have everything figured out now? Nope. Still struggling. Still kind of lost. But at least now, I feel like Iâ€™m headed somewhere good.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™ve learned from life, itâ€™s this: just do you. Respect  and understand others, but at the end of the day you only have your self so, live life your way.</p>

<p>Until next time, hopefully my next blog will be anÂ "ass-kicking"! ðŸ˜‰
